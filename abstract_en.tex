This work compares publicly available \textit{continuous integration} (\CI) and \textit{continuous deployment} systems. Evaluated systems include \textit{GitLab, Jenkins, GoCD, Drone, Concourse, CircleCI, Travis~CI} and \textit{Semaphore~CI}. Each of those was used to deploy all three of those different web applications: static, complex app with external dependencies and containerized. The comparison is primarily based on functionality, security, availability and extendibility. In the second part of the work, \textit{GitLab} is recognized as a most appropriate tool and it\'s deployed at \textit{manGoweb} web studio.
